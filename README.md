# Breast_Cancer_Prediction-ML-
This project aims the prediction of breast cancer. It consists of 33 attributes and a class label shown as target. Different algorithms are used including KNN, SVM, Decision tree, Random Forest etc. Moreover to get a better accuracy factor oversampling, under sampling and PCA analysis was also used. The graphs show the relation between different attributes. The obtained prediction has an accuracy of 96 percent.
